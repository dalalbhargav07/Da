# Data Warehousing & Data Analytics


## 1. [Relational DBMS (MySQL) vs NoSQL (Elastic Search)](https://github.com/dalalbhargav07/Data-Warehousing-to-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Relational%20DBMS%20(MySQL)%20vs%20NoSQL)
This mini project compares conventional RDBMS using MySQL and no structure DBMS using Elastic Search (NoSQL) which is installed on Microsoft Azure ubuntu instance.
* Technologies Used:
	* Microsoft Azure
	* Amazon Web Service
	* Elastic Search
	* MySQL WorkBench

## 2. [Sentimental Analysis using Elastic Search and Python](https://github.com/dalalbhargav07/Data-Warehousing-to-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Sentimental%20Analysis%20using%20Elastic%20Search%20and%20Python)
In this porject, performed the sentimental analysis by understanding the extracting, transforming and loading the data process into NoSQL database. Furthermore, this processed data is analyzed using basic machine learning algorithm such as rienforcement learning.
* Technologies Used:
	* Microsoft Azure
	* Elastic Search
	* Python 3.6
	
## 3. [Classification of live streaming tweets using pyspark](https://github.com/dalalbhargav07/Data-Warehousing-to-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Classification%20of%20live%20streaming%20tweets%20using%20pyspark)
In this project, performed the classification on live data streaming from social media platform (Twitter) by using the big data analytical tool (Apache Spark).
* Technologies Used:
	* Microsoft Azure
	* Python 3.6
		* pyspark
		* tweepy
		
## 4. [Analysing and creating the dashboard for building permits data](https://github.com/dalalbhargav07/Data-Warehousing-to-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Analysing%20and%20creating%20the%20dashboard%20for%20building%20permits%20data)
Peformed the data analysis using various data analytical tools to create the dashboard as well as varied graphs to extract the intelligent information from the data.
* Technologies Used:
	* Microsoft Power BI  
  
## 5.  [Analytics using MS Azure Data Lake](https://github.com/dalalbhargav07/Data-Warehousing-to-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Analytics%20using%20MS%20Azure%20Data%20Lake)
Converted and imported the CSV format file in the Microsoft Azure Data Lake using U-SQL. Extracted the requested information from the data set and stored in the CSV file. Downloaded the new CSV file and loaded it in the Microsoft PowerBI to generate dashboard as well as various graphs.
* Technologies Used:
	* Microsoft Azure Data Lake
	* U-SQL
	* Microsoft Power BI
	* Python 3.6

## 6. [Exploring, Anlaysing and Classification of the dataset](https://github.com/dalalbhargav07/Data-Warehousing-to-Data-Analytics/tree/master/Exploring%2C%20Anlaysing%20and%20Classification%20of%20the%20dataset)
Identified the patterns through simulation of data. Data was initially cleaned and processed. The processed data was explored and anlysed using various plots. Finally, based on the analysis patterns were identified using machine learning algorithms applied using sklearn.
* Technologies Used:
	* Python 3.6
		* pandas
		* scikit-learn
	* Tableau
